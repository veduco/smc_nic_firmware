# Supermicro AOC-STGF-i2S Firmwares
The Supermicro AOC-STGF-i2S PCIe card is an Intel x710 based NIC.  
Outside of Supermicro machines which can utilize the NCSI connection, its main feature is its short form factor.  
Its form factor is similar to the AOC-STGN-i2S card, but that card is Niantec based.  
This card easily fits into Lenovo Tiny PCIe enabled machines without having to remove the front WiFi hardware.  

**Note:**  
The firmwares in this repository were sourced from SMC.  
After many attempts, it does not seem possible to crossflash this card to native INTC firmware.
